        "Because a dict uses a hash table internally, and hash tables must be sparse to work, they are not space efficient. For example, if you are handling a large quantity of records, it makes sense to store them in a list of tuples or named tuples instead of using a list of dictionaries in JSON style, with one dict per record.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key search is very fast:**\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Key ordering depends on insertion order**\n",
        "When a hash collision happens, the second key ends up in a position that it would not normally occupy if it had been inserted first. So, a dict built as `dict([(key1, value1), (key2, value2)])` compares equal to `dict([(key2, value2), (key1, value1)])`, but their key ordering may not be the same if the hashes of key1 and key2 collide."
